                                JThread ChangeLog
				  
			 	    ---------
 1.1.0 (September 2004)
 	* Important change: In your own void *Thread() function, you
	  now have to call JThread::ThreadStarted() at the start of
	  the function. Until this function is called, the Start()
	  function blocks. This way, when the Start() function is
	  finished, we can be really really sure that our own thread
	  is running.

 1.0.1 (August 2004)
 	* configure now detects pdflatex and listings package: 
	  only if these are found, documentation is built.

 1.0.0 (February 2001)
 	* Initial release
	* Thanks to Stijn Vansummeren (stijnvs@lumumba.luc.ac.be) for fixing
	  a bug in the JThread::GetReturnValue() function
